## üìë Short Report: Blockchain Platform Comparison & Recommendation

Blockchain platforms vary in architecture and purpose. In this comparison, we explore Ethereum (public), Hyperledger Fabric (private), and Quorum (consortium).

Ethereum is a public, permissionless blockchain that uses Proof of Stake. It supports powerful smart contracts written in Solidity and is ideal for building decentralized applications (DApps) like DeFi platforms and NFTs. However, it suffers from relatively lower base TPS (~30), though Layer 2 solutions offer scalability.

Hyperledger Fabric is a private, enterprise-grade blockchain with modular design and pluggable consensus. It supports smart contracts called chaincode and offers extremely high throughput (3000+ TPS). Its private channels make it perfect for use cases like healthcare, logistics, or supply chains among known entities.

Quorum, built on Ethereum, serves consortium-based use cases. It provides Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, enhanced privacy features, and controlled participation, making it suitable for financial institutions or banks working together.

### ‚úÖ Recommendations:
- For a decentralized app (DApp) ‚Üí Ethereum: open, widely adopted, smart contract-focused.
- For a supply chain among partners ‚Üí Hyperledger Fabric: secure, fast, and private.
- For an inter-bank financial app ‚Üí Quorum: privacy + shared access among trusted nodes.
